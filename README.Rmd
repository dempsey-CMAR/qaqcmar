`qaqcmar` applies quality control flags to Water Quality data collected through the Centre for Marine Applied Research's (CMAR) Coastal Monitoring Program.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `qaqcmar` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dempsey-CMAR/qaqcmar")
```

## Background

### Coastal Monitoring Program

The Centre for Marine Applied Research ([CMAR](https://cmar.ca/)) coordinates an extensive [Coastal Monitoring Program](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/) to measure [Essential Ocean Variables](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114) from around the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. There are three main branches of the program: _Water Quality_, _Currents_, and _Waves_. Summary reports and full datasets for each branch can be viewed and downloaded from several sources, as outlined in the [CMAR Report & Data Access Cheat Sheet](https://cmar.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/07/Report-Data-Access-2024-07-30.pdf).


### Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

CMAR applies Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) processes to support the delivery of high quality data (Bushnell et al, 2019). QA processes are typically completed prior to sensor deployment (e.g., sensor calibration and validation), and are documented in a series of Standard Operating Procedures. 

Quality Control processes (e.g., automated data flags, manual review) are completed for each deployment after the data have been collected and compiled. CMAR has adapted the QARTOD (Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data) flagging scheme and associated tests. QARTOD provides a relatively simple yet informative rating scale, and is very well documented. QARTOD manuals provide codeable instructions for implementing recommended QC tests. QARTOD has been adopted by oceanographic organizations around the world, including the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).

For more information on the Quality Control tests and thresholds, visit the [CMAR Data Governance Website](https://dempsey-cmar.github.io/cmp-data-governance/pages/cmp_about.html).

`qaqcmar` automates assigning flags to each observation based on QARTOD recommendations and CMAR modifications.

## Example

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(qaqcmar)
library(sensorstrings)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(lubridate)
```

### Example Sensor String Data

Consider simulated Water Quality data from January 1 to December 2023.(Note: this data was simulated to illustrate quality control processes and does not reflect expected profiles.)


```{r}
# read in example data
path <- system.file("testdata", package = "qaqcmar")

dat <- readRDS(paste0(path, "/test_data_grossrange.RDS")) 

kable(dat[1:5, ])
```

```{r fig1, fig.height=6}
ss_ggplot_variables(dat) + geom_point(size = 1)
```


### Apply QC flags

`qaqcmar` includes a separate function for each QC test. For example, `qc_test_grossrange()` applies the gross range test by adding a a `grossrange_flag_**` column for each variable in `dat`.


#### Gross Range Test

Apply test:
```{r, message=FALSE}
dat_gr <- qc_test_grossrange(dat, county = "Lunenburg")

kable(dat_gr[1:5, ])
```

The flagged data can be plotted with `qc_plot_flags()`, specifying argument `qc_tests = "grossrange"`.
```{r fig2}
dat_gr %>% 
  qc_pivot_longer(qc_tests = "grossrange") %>% 
  qc_plot_flags( qc_tests = "grossrange", ncol = 2)
```


#### All Tests

`qc_test_all()` will apply all specified QC tests to `dat`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
dat_qc <- dat %>%
  qc_test_all(qc_tests = c("climatology", "grossrange"), county = "Lunenburg")

kable(dat_qc[1:5, ])
```

There are now `r ncol(dat_qc)` columns in `dat_qc`!

`qc_assign_max_flag()` reduces the number of columns in `dat_qc` by keeping the *worst* flag for each variable. 

```{r}
dat_qc <- dat_qc %>%
  qc_assign_max_flag(qc_tests = c("climatology", "grossrange"))

kable(dat_qc[1:5, ])
```

The flagged data can be plotted with `qc_plot_flags()`, specifying argument `qc_tests = "qc"`.

```{r fig3}
dat_qc %>% 
  qc_pivot_longer(qc_tests = "qc") %>% 
  qc_plot_flags(qc_tests = "qc")
```
