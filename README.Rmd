The goal of qaqcmar is to apply quality control flags to Water Quality data collected through the Centre for Marine Applied Research's (CMAR) Coastal Monitoring Program.

## Installation

You can install the development version of qaqcmar from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dempsey-CMAR/qaqcmar")
```

## Background

### Coastal Monitoring Program

The Centre for Marine Applied Research ([CMAR](https://cmar.ca/)) coordinates an extensive [Coastal Monitoring Program](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/) to measure [Essential Ocean Variables](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114) from around the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. There are three main branches of the program: _Water Quality_, _Currents_, and _Waves_. Processed data for each branch can be viewed and downloaded from several sources, as outlined in the [CMAR Report & Data Access Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings/blob/master/man/figures/README-access-cheatsheet.pdf) (download for clickable links).


### Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

CMAR applies Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) processes to support the delivery of high quality data (Bushnell et al, 2019). QA processes are typically completed prior to sensor deployment (e.g., sensor calibration and validation), and are documented in a series of Standard Operating Procedures(link here). 

Quality Control processes (e.g., automated data flags, manual review) are completed for each deployment after the data have been collected and compiled. CMAR has adopted the QARTOD (Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data) flagging scheme and associated tests. QARTOD provides a relatively simple yet informative rating scale (Table X), and is very well documented. There are QARTOD manuals for 34 EOVs that provide codeable instructions for implementing recommended QC tests. QARTOD has been adopted by oceanographic organizations around the world, including the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).


`qaqcmar` is a quality control tool that automates assigning flags to each observation based on QARTOD recommendations.

## Example


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(qaqcmar)
library(sensorstrings)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(lubridate)
```

### Example Sensor String Data

Consider example Water Quality data collected from October 1, 2021 to October 31, 2021. Note that some observations are far higher or lower than what would be reasonably expected.
(Note: this is fake data generated from two deployments for illustrative purposes.)


```{r}
# read in example data
path <- system.file("testdata", package = "qaqcmar")

dat <- readRDS(paste0(path, "/test_data_grossrange.RDS")) %>% 
  select(-c(latitude, longitude))

kable(dat[1:5, ])

```

```{r fig1, fig.height=8}
ss_ggplot_variables(dat)
```


### Apply QC flags

`qcqcmar` includes a separate function for each QC test. For example, `qc_test_grossrange()` applies the gross range test by adding a a `grossrange_flag_**` column for each variable in `dat`.


#### Gross Range Test

Apply test:
```{r}
dat_gr <- qc_test_grossrange(dat)

kable(dat_gr[1:5, ])
```

The flagged data can be plotted with `qc_plot_flags()`, specifying argument `qc_tests = "grossrange"`.
```{r fig2}
qc_plot_flags(dat_gr, qc_tests = "grossrange", ncol = 2)
```


#### All Tests

`qc_test_all()` will apply all specified QC tests to `dat`.

```{r}
dat_qc <- dat %>% 
  qc_test_all(qc_tests = c("climatology", "grossrange")) 

kable(dat_qc[1:5, ])
```

There are now `r ncol(dat_qc)` columns in `dat_qc`!

`qc_assign_max_flag()` reduces the number of columns in `dat_qc` by keeping the *worst* flag for each variable. 

```{r}
dat_qc <- dat_qc %>% 
 qc_assign_max_flag()

kable(dat_qc[1:5, ])
```

The flagged data can be plotted with `qc_plot_flags()`, specifying argument `qc_tests = "qc"`.

```{r fig3}
qc_plot_flags(dat_qc, qc_tests = "qc")
```
