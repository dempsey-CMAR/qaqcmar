\usage{
qc_plot_flags(
  dat,
  qc_tests = c("climatology", "depth_crosscheck", "grossrange", "rolling_sd", "spike"),
  vars = "all",
  labels = TRUE,
  ncol = NULL,
  flag_title = TRUE,
  plotly_friendly = FALSE,
  jitter_height = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Data frame of flagged sensor string data in long or wide format.
Must include at least one column name with the string "_flag_variable".}

\item{qc_tests}{Character vector of quality control tests to apply to
\code{dat}. Defaults to all available tests: \code{qc_tests =
  c("climatology", "depth_crosscheck", "grossrange", "rolling_sd", "spike")}.}

\item{vars}{Character vector of variables to plot. Default is \code{vars =
"all"}, which will make a plot for each recognized variable in \code{dat}.}

\item{labels}{Logical argument indicating whether to convert numeric flag
values to text labels for the legend.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for faceted plots.}

\item{flag_title}{Logical argument indicating whether to include a ggtitle of
the qc test and variable plotted.}

\item{plotly_friendly}{Logical argument. If \code{TRUE}, the legend will be
plotted when \code{plotly::ggplotly} is called on \code{p}. Default is
\code{FALSE}, which makes the legend look better in a static figure.}

\item{jitter_height}{Numeric value. Amount of vertical jitter in the
deth_crosscheck figure. Only recommended to check for overlapping deployment
points because it introduces random noise into the scatter plot that can be
misleading.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of ggplot objects; one figure for each test in
\code{qc_tests} and variable in \code{vars}. Points are coloured by the flag
value and panels are faceted by depth and sensor. faceted by depth and
sensor.
